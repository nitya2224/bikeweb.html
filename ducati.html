                <li>A month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the
                "Cucciolo" (Italian for "puppy," in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound) to the public</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the buyer; however, businessmen soon
                bought the little engines in quantity, and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>In 1950, after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold, in collaboration with SIATA, the Ducati firm offered its own
                Cucciolo-based motorcycle.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>his first Ducati motorcycle was a 48 cc bike weighing 98 lb (44 kg), with a top speed of 40 mph (64 km/h), and had a 15
                mm carburetor (0.59 in) giving just under 200 mpg‑US (1.2 L/100 km; 240 mpg‑imp).</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>When the market moved toward larger motorcycles, Ducati management decided to respond, making an impression at an
                early-1952 Milan show, introducing their 65TS cycle and Cruiser (a four-stroke motor scooter).</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show, the Cruiser was not a great success, and
                only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production</li>
